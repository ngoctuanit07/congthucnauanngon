Speed optimization is vital for SEO. Optimize your PageSpeed scores today!

== Description ==

**Speed Booster Pack** is maintained & operated by **[Optimocha](https://optimocha.com/)**, a company that offers special speed optimization services filled with people who *obsess* about speed!

WordPress is, hands down, the most popular content management system in the world. But like all giants, WordPress gets bigger and bigger every release; and it needs you to stay healthy and fast. Otherwise, your website can get slower and nobody likes slow websites. *NOBODY*. Not only your visitors hate your website, but also search engines (especially Google) penalizes you and drop your search engine rankings.

Improving your site's speed will get you a better score on major speed testing services such as [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/), [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) and will also improve your overall site's usability. This will help Google and other search engines to rank your site higher in search results thus sending more traffic.

### Benefits of Speed Booster Pack

Each second of delay can cause up to 20% loss in conversion rates ([source: Google](https://web.dev/why-speed-matters/)). "Conversion" means *converting* visitors to something more than a "visitor": leads, customers, subscribers, followers... you name it.

You might lose more than half of your visitors if your website loads **slower than three seconds**! ([source: Google again](https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/the-need-for-mobile-speed/)) This is a huge problem, and it's hugely overlooked among other SEO-related concerns. People don't realize how important speed is, in the eyes of search engines.

That's where Speed Booster Pack comes in: With its ever-evolving codebase, Speed Booster Pack aims to increase your site performance, page load times and PageSpeed (Lighthouse) scores! Optimocha, the company behind Speed Booster Pack, has a team with a mutual obsession for speed; so you can be sure that your site will be in good hands.

### How Speed Booster Pack helps you get better PageSpeed scores:

* **CSS optimization**: You can inline and minify all CSS in your pages, and save on HTTP requests.
* **JavaScript optimization**: Deferring JS and moving them into the footer makes them non-render-blocking, which Google PageSpeed likes *so much*.
* **(NEW!) Lazy loading**: With the latest native browser feature for lazy loading *and* a state-of-the-art lazy loader script, your images will load as soon as they're in the viewport (instead of all at once). This alone can make your site faster than ever!
* **Remove clutter**: Clutter is always bad, especially for page sources; and faster websites have less clutter inside their pages. Removing unnecessary junk is key to solid speed optimization work.
* **(NEW!) Instant Page**: This brand new tool helps your visitors get to the *next* page in your website by prefetching any internal link the visitor's about to click. It's not AI or anything but it's a pretty smart way to optimize your site!
* **Disable unnecessary stuff**: This one's a no-brainer - if there's less work for WordPress, it works faster.
* **(NEW!) WooCommerce optimization**: WooCommerce is awesome and all, but it could use some help to speed up. And Speed Booster Pack does exactly that: With a few tweaks, it resolves some WooCommerce speed bottlenecks.
* **CDN integration**: Content delivery networks are essential for every website, especially if its visitors come from all around the world. With Speed Booster Pack's CDN integration feature, you can easily start using the CDN of your choice in WordPress.
* **Google Analytics localization**: Google itself can surely benefit from a speed optimization job, but they're not picking up our calls. Oh well, the least we can do is to help you load Google Analytics from your own server.
* **...and much more**: We're constantly working on building a better performance optimization plugin for tens of thousands of people, and hundreds more downloading Speed Booster Pack every day. Rest assured, our roadmap is always full of new ideas!
