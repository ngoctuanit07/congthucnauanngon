== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I need to input in the box that's titled `Facebook page`? =

When you add the widget, you can insert your Facebook page name. If your Facebook-url is https://facebook.com/quoteshirts, the only thing you need to insert is just 'quoteshirts'.

You can also input your Facebook page ID. This is the 'unfriendly' identifier of your page
If you need help finding it, we recommend using one of these websites:

= I have selected 'show faces' but I don't see any, why? =

Because of privacy (GDPR), Facebook only shows face of your own friends, and you have to be logged in for that.
